# CarDa By Team Reeb
Throughout the International virtual innovation challenge, team reeb got the assignment to create a digital solution, that contributes in making skiing more sustainable.
After interviewing stakeholders, who mostly said, that they usually go skiing by car, evebthough they know its not good for the environment, team Reeb came up with the idea of CarDa.

## What is Carda?

CarDa is an App, to find people near you to go skiing with. The main idea is, that the person offering a ride is searching for friends or a date and inserts his ride into CarDa, with all the information needed. 
The users who are asking for a ride than can see the offered rides and can "match" with the person offering it. In the ideal case, the driver will pick up the other person and they will share the ride. In the end both will have saved CO2, because they only used one instead of two cars.

## Storyboard
The following storyboard, that has been created for CarDa, is showing, how the team imagined the usage of the app.

## Why should someone use CarDa?

Obviously, the person offering a ride and paying the fuel, should have some benefits as well. Therefore CarDa will forge some partnerships wiht local businesses in the skiing areas. After the ride has been done, the driver can than claim benefits like a free parkinglot or discount on food or drinks in the skiing area.
All users, who use CarDa, will at least have a less bad consience, because they will have a smaller CO2 footprint, then if they would go with their own car.
