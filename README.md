## Ready to save the environment with love? Then let's dive right into it and see what CarDa is all about!

CarDa is an App, to find people near you to go skiing with. The main idea is, that the person offering a ride is searching for friends or a date and inserts his ride into CarDa, with all the information needed. 
The users who are asking for a ride than can see the offered rides and can "match" with the person offering it. In the ideal case, the driver will pick up the other person and they will share the ride. In the end both will have saved CO2, because they only used one instead of two cars.

The following storyboard, that has been created for CarDa, is showing, how the team imagined the usage of the app.

# Talking about business, CarDa's business model 

AMAZING NEWS! CarDa is a Freemium! Can you believe your luck?

CarDa is not just a gimmick to show, that DSV is trying to be more sustainable, but it can also be moetarized as well. The revenue Streams can be broken down into 3 main streams:
  1. Advertisement: CarDa implements multiple slots to add advertisement to the app, that will be rolled out to all the free users. These slots can be sold to companys to earn          money
  2. Premium version: Like in many so called "freemium" apps, users will be able to get an advertisment free version of the app, if they pay for the usage. The premium version          wont only give the users a better user experience, but premium users will also get better benefits in the skiing areas then free users.
  3. Partnerships with local businesses: In the starting phase, CarDa will need some founding partnerships, to be able to provide benefits for the driver from the begining.          After this is achieved, CarDa will start a membership program for businesses. In this case the business will pay a small amount of money monthly and provide benefits.            Therefore the businesses can expect, that users of CarDa will be more likely to e.g. eat in a specific restaurant where they get a discount instead of going to another          restaurant where they would have to pay the full price.
